# Practical Linux Provenance

[CamFlow](http://camflow.org/) is a [Linux Security Module (LSM)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/lsm/) designed to capture data provenance for the purpose of system audit.
The provenance capture mechanism is highly configurable, and can fit many applications' particular needs.
CamFlow can stack with existing security modules such as SELinux.
