In this tutorial we will look at how to capture and look at the provenance generated by `wget`. The tutorial assume CamFlow has been installed and is running on a Fedora machine, and that the reader has some familiarity with the following [our paper describing linux provenance capture (ACM SoCC'17)](https://github.com/CamFlow/publications/blob/master/2017socc.pdf)

We first need to install `nano` to easily edit files (any other text editor will obviously do):
```
$ sudo dnf install nano
```

First we should verify that our kernel indeed contains CamFlow:
```
$ uname -r
X.X.Xcamflow_Y.Y.Y
```
X.X.X corresponds to the kernel version, and Y.Y.Y to CamFlow version.

You can check system events relating to CamFlow as follow:
```
$ journalctl -b -0 | grep camflow
```

We next check the configuration option available to us:
```
$ camflow -h
-h usage.
-v version.
-s print provenance capture state.
-e <bool> enable/disable provenance capture.
-a <bool> activate/deactivate whole-system provenance capture.
--compress <bool> activate/deactivate node compression.
-p return policy hash.
--file <filename> display provenance info of a file.
--track-file <filename> <false/true/propagate> set tracking.
--label-file <filename> <string> applies label to the file.
--opaque-file <filename> <bool> mark/unmark the file as opaque.
--process <pid> display provenance info of a process.
--track-process <pid> <false/true/propagate> set tracking.
--label-process <pid> <string> applies label to the process.
--opaque-process <pid> <bool> mark/unmark the process as opaque.
--track-ipv4-ingress <ip/mask:port> <track/propagate/record/delete> track/propagate on bind.
--track-ipv4-egress <ip/mask:port> <track/propagate/record/delete> track/propagate on connect.
--track-secctx <security context> <track/propagate/delete> track/propagate based on security context.
--track-cgroup <cgroup ino> <track/propagate/delete> track/propagate based on cgroup.
--track-user <user name> <track/propagate/delete> track/propagate based on user.
--track-cgroup <group name> <track/propagate/delete> track/propagate based on group.
--node-filter <type> <bool> set node filter.
--edge-filter <type> <bool> set edge filter.
--node-propagate-filter <type> <bool> set propagate node filter.
--edge-propagate-filter <type> <bool> set propagate edge filter.
--reset-filter reset filters.
```

We first want to check the current configuration state:
```
$ camflow -s
Policy hash: 141469288B16F0FFD7E575CEA156FA3EA3FCDD4C62A0381C3588152D2D17E7
Provenance capture:
- capture enabled;
- all disabled;
- compress enabled;

Node filter (640):
Relation filter (8008000):

Propagate node filter (640):
Propagate relation filter (0):
IPv4 ingress filter (0).
IPv4 egress filter (0).
Security context filter (0).
Namespace filter (0).
User filter (0).
Group filter (0).
```
The policy hash is based on CamFlow version and the currently loaded capture policy. It can be used to quickly verify that two machines are running the same capture policy. It can also be obtained with `camflow -p`.

Lets try to capture the provenance generated by the well known tool `wget`. We want to track and propagate provenance from its executable. We can do so as follow:
```
$ sudo camflow --track-file /bin/wget propagate
```

We can see the provenance status of the executable file as follow:
```
$ camflow --file /bin/wget
Identifier: AAEAAAAAACBDVwMAAAAAABwAAAAHfl4eAAAAAAAAAAA=
Type: file
ID: 218947
Boot ID: 28
Machine ID: 509509127
Version: 0
Taint: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

File is tracked.
File is not opaque.
File propagates tracking.
```
We notice that our file is being tracked, and propagating the tracking.

If we run wget, we should be able to obtain some provenance data:
```
$ wget www.google.com
$ tail /tmp/audit.log

We can see that some provenance JSON has indeed been generated. You can check [here](./w3c.md) to see what this data means. Publishing the provenance is the job of `camflowd`, lets look at its configuration to understand what it is doing:
```
$ cat /etc/camflowd.ini
[general]
; used for test and debug purpose
; output=null
; output=mqtt
output=log
log=/tmp/audit.log

[mqtt]
address=m12.cloudmqtt.com:17065
username=camflow
password=test
; message delivered: 0 at most once, 1 at least once, 2 exactly once
qos=2
```
The system is clearly configured to publish the provenance to a log file, and this file has been specified to be `/tmp/audit.log`. If we were to publish our provenance to MQTT, we could visualise it in real time on our [demo website](http://camflow.org/demo). Note that change to camflowd configuration requires the system or the service to be rebooted.

We have seen that we could edit the capture configuration via the command line. If we want something a bit more permanent and practical, we can edit `/etc/camflow.ini`. This file is read during the boot process by `camconfd` service, and used to set the capture policy. Lets have a look at this configuration file:
```
$ cat /etc/camflow.ini
[provenance]
;unique identifier for the machine, use hostid if set to 0
machine_id=0
;enable provenance capture
enabled=true
;record provenance of all kernel object
all=false
; enable node compression
compress=true
node_filter=directory
node_filter=inode_unknown
node_filter=char
relation_filter=sh_read
relation_filter=sh_write
